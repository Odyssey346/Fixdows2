Fixdows is an open source utility written in C#/.NET that allows you to fix issues with a Windows installation. 

## Features

* Disk Cleanup
* Printer Spooler fix
* Integrity Fix
* Microsoft Store Fix

More will be added in the future.

## Download

The recommended place to get Fixdows is from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NQZKZJZ4Z0V). I will also be adding GitHub releases in the future.

## i18n

Fixdows has the ability to be translated into other languages, however, I need to improve how strings work before anyone can start translating.
